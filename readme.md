### Teknoware Project

1. The team is Me
2. Repo is this one
3. I'll be doing idea 1 like the others, because it seems somewhat simpler (Not necessarily easier). Since I'm by myself, I'll do a simple thingamajig that when turned on (powered) checks the location, time and the time of sunrise and sunset (once). It then adjusts some light fixture's brightness.
4. Assuming that the project ends before christmas, thats the deadline. Because it's just me doing this, setting any artificial deadlines is useless. I am simply too lazy and apathetic. I just hope I get shit done during these 6 hours every week.
5. I do everything. :(
6. I communicate with myself through pigeons.
7.
